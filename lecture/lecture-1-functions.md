# JavaScript FUNdamentals
## Functions

---

- Functions are the main “building blocks” of a program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.
- They can take some input and `return` an output.
- Functions need to be **called**. 

> A function that is never called is like a computer that is never turned on.

 ## Example 1

```js
// Formula for the area of a rectangle
"The area of a rectangle is equal to it's length multiplied by it's width"

// Turn that into a more math-like function
area = width * length

// Define JavaScript function

// Call the JavaScript function
```

---

 ## Example 2

```js
// Formula for the area of a circle
"The area of a circle is equal to pi times the radius squared"

// Turn that into a more math-like function
area = pi * radius * radius

// Define JavaScript function

// Call the JavaScript function
```

---

- Functions let you group and reuse code.
- Define a function with parameters between the brackets.
- To call the function (i.e. use it), you pass it arguments whose values take the place of the parameters in the function definition.
- The function acts just like any other expression when called.
- It produces the value you'd expect from the body of the function.

> A function that is never called is like a light bulb without electricity.

## Exercises

```js
// Q1. Write a function that returns the sum of 3 numbers.

// Q2. Write a function that returns the square 
// of a number minus twice the number.

// Q3. Write a function that returns the a
// person's full name, given their first and last names.

// Q4. Write a function that returns the value of the tax (15%) 
// for a given amount.

// Q5. Write a function that returns the value 42.

// Q6. Write a function that returns "Hello!".
```

- Functions are key in implementing software development principles.
- Complexity emerges from simplicity.

> A function that is never called is like a poem that is never read.
